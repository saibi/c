Google has launched a communications system that uses the companyâ€™s Android phones to detect earthquakes. It aims to provide timely information about earthquakes to phones that run the mobile operating system.

The new warning system has already been tested in California, which has more damaging quakes than any other part of the United States.

To develop the system, the company worked with the U.S. Geological Survey - USGS - a federal agency that uses seismographic equipment to measure earthquake activity.

Technology for predicting earthquakes does not yet exist. But the USGS says it does have equipment to predict seismic activity near a quake. This means it is possible to warn people in areas where such activity is expected. People could then get several seconds or perhaps up to a minute of warning before a quake strikes.

The USGS joined several university partners in developing the new warning system, called ShakeAlert.
